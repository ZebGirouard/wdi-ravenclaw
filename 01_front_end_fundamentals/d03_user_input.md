## User Input

It is time for you to explore how to accept user input on your own. Web browsers have three default methods that accept user input. They are:

* `prompt(stringArgument);`
* `confirm(stringArgument);`
* `alert(stringArgument);`

#### Challenge

1. In classical programming languages, methods that are not **void** return methods.
2. Which of these three built-in browser methods are **void**?
3. Which are not?
4. What is the data type that these return?

*Hint*: You can assign user input to a variable and then call it later.

#### Research

When you continuously spam a user with these methods, most **evergreen** browsers will provide the ability to hide popups from a specific website forever. How would this affect your development?

Take a few moments to research the pitfalls of using these browser methods for user input. Have you found any suggestions or alternatives?
