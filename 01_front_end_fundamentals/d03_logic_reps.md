## Logic

### Objectives

- Differentiate between true, false, 'truth-y', and 'false-y'
- Use if/else if/else conditionals to control program flow based on boolean conditions
- Use switch conditionals to control program flow based on explicit conditions
- Use comparison operators to evaluate and compare statements
- Use boolean logic (!, &&, ||) to combine and manipulate conditionals
